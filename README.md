### DATA CLEANING AND PREPARATION
In this aspect the data was loaded, inspected and cleaned . 
  - Using Power query to standardize the product name and categories,
  - Corrected the inconsistent date format,
  - Removed rows with missing data.

### EXPLORATORY DATA ANLYSIS
This involves exploring the data to answer questions like
1. How many records are missing important details like sale date or status, and how could that affect our analysis?
2. What is the total revenue generated for each product and category?
3. Can you identify any trends in sales over time, despite the inconsistent date entries?
4. Which store location sold the highest and lowest number of products?
5. What is the average price within each product category, and are there any unusual or extreme values?
6. Which products are performing best in terms of quantity sold and total revenue?
7. Are we overstocking or understocking any specific products based on the current sales data?
8. Which store locations have the highest rate of product returns, and is there any identifiable pattern?
9. Can you build a dashboard that shows product performance by category and by store location?
10. Are there certain products that are being returned more frequently than others, and why might that be?
11. How does each product’s performance differ across store locations like Lagos, Abuja, and Ibadan?
12. Can you detect any seasonal patterns in product sales even with inconsistent date formats?
13. What impact are returned products having on our overall revenue?
14. Is there any connection between a product’s category, its price, and how well it sells?
